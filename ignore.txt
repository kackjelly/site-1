Contact section: Provide a way for potential clients or employers to contact you, such as through a contact form or email address.

Responsive design: Ensure that your website is responsive and works well on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Clean and professional design: Use a clean and professional design that is easy to navigate and showcases your work in the best possible way.

Personal touch: Add some personal touches to your website to help you stand out, such as a custom logo or color scheme, or a section about your hobbies or interests outside of work.
